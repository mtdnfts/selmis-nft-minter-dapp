    <h2>Step by Step to purchase a Selmi's NFT</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Choose a Device to Use</h3>
    <p>You can use either your mobile device or your PC. However the process will be easier if you are on your PC.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Use Google Chrome</h3>
    <p>If you are using your PC make sure to use Google Chrome or another browser that is compatible with MetaMask. This does not apply on a mobile device. If you do not have Google Chrome download it <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/">here.</a></p>
    <h3>Step 3: Download MetaMask</h3>
    <p>You need MATIC, a form of crypto currency, to purchase a Selmi's NFT. The first step to purchasing crypto currency is getting your crypto wallet, MetaMask is the one of the most trusted wallets in the world with millions of users. If you are using a PC you can download MetaMask, as an extension, from the Google Chrome store <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en">here.</a> If you are using your mobile device, download MetaMask from the app store. Create your wallet through MetaMask by either going into the app or through the Google Chrome extension.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Connect Wallet</h3>
    <p>After you have created your wallet, connect it to the <a href="https://selmisnfts.com/">Selmi's NFTs</a> website by pressing the Connect Wallet button in the top right corner. Once you are prompted to connect, press connect. Then the second prompt will ask you to allow the website to add a network and switch your network, do so. If you do not get the second prompt simply reload the page until you do. </p>
    <p>If you are using your mobile device make sure to use MetaMask's built in browser to go to selmisnfts.com, you can find the browser by pressing the three lines in the top left corner in the MetaMask app.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Buy Matic</h3>
    <p>Now you need to purchase your MATIC. On mobile all you have to do is open MetaMask, press the Buy button on the main wallet page and follow the prompts. On PC, just click on the extension and press the Buy button aswell. Make sure that you are on the Polygon Mainnet. The Polygon Mainet is the blockchain that Selmi's NFTs is on, so it is impossible to purchase one without being on its network. The status can be seen at the top of your screen on both PC and mobile. If you are not, go back to Step 4.</p>
    <p>Selmi's NFTs are 2000 Matic or equivelent to about 1250 USD. This means that you will NEED 2000 MATIC even after fees.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Buy Your Selmi's NFT</h3>
    <p>After a long process you have made it. Go back to the website and add as many NFTs as you want, even though you only need one NFT to be apart of the Selmi's Exclusive Benefits Club. Then press the Mint Your NFT button, digitally sign and accept the transaction through the MetaMask prompt. Be patient as it may take some time to process the transaction. If you do not see the Mint Your NFT button go back to Step 4.</p>
    <h3>Step 7: Enroll at Tokenproof</h3>
    <p>When you have purchased your NFT press the Enroll Here button and then enroll at Tokenproof to claim your benefits at Selmi's Farm. This will require a phone, so if your using mobile either switch to a PC or use another phone.</p>
    <h3>Step 8: Enjoy Your NFT!</h3>
    <p>Now you have your Selmi's NFT! You can go use your benefits that are worth thousands of dollars or you can try and sell your NFT to another customer of Selmi's for a profit on <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea.</a> We can not wait to see you at Selmis!</p>
